# README

## Introduction

Welcome to my Dart Flutter Project. This project has been built using Dart and Flutter. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Git ([Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- Flutter SDK ([Download here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
- Dart SDK (Comes with Flutter)
- An IDE like VS Code or IntelliJ (with Flutter plugin)

### Installation

Follow these steps to get the app running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repo**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/Waariss/Temple-Trip.git` (replace with your Github username and project name).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Waariss/Temple-Trip.git
```

2. **Navigate into the directory** 

```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT
```

3. **Get the dependencies**: Run the following command in your terminal after navigating into the cloned directory.

```bash
flutter pub get
```

4. **Check for issues**: Before running the app, check for any dependency issues by running this command:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Resolve any issues before proceeding.

5. **Run the app**: Now you can run the app on your connected device (emulator/physical) using:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Using the Application

(Describe how to use the application here. Include all necessary steps so a new user could easily understand how to navigate and perform key operations.)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems, try the following:

- Ensure you have the latest versions of all required software.
- Delete the `pubspec.lock` file and run `flutter pub get` again.
- Clean the Flutter build by running `flutter clean`.

If problems persist, feel free to create an issue on this Github repo.
